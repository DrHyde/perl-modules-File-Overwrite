Ths module provides functionality to overwrite the contents of a file,
and also to overwrite and then delete.  This is intended to protect
against people using simple file recovery tools.  Note that it does NOT
protect against all such tools, and makes all kinds of assumptions
about your filesystem.  If in doubt, melt the disk.

To install, do the usual:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You may use, modify and distribute this code under the same terms as you
may use, modify and distribute perl itself.
